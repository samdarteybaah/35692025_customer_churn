 This project is an AI model used to predict possible churn in the a telecommunication firm
 This AI model can be used to predict whether a customer will churn or not, which uses certain characteristics to determine this probability.
 It uses MLP to train, GridSearchCV to tune the model. These are the functionalities

 A model is trained, tuned and deployed with streamlit to build a web app

The web app takes in inputs from the necessary features: ['MonthlyCharges', 'TotalCharges', 'tenure', 'Contract', 'PaymentMethod_encoded', 'InternetService'] from the user.

It then predicts whether a customer would churn or not based on the answered features and the probability or likelihood of correctness
